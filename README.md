# Instagram-User-Analytics
Analyzing user interactions and engagement with the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can help the business grow.User analysis involves tracking how users engage with a digital product, such as a software application or a mobile app. The insights derived from this analysis can be used by various teams within the business. For example, the marketing team might use these insights to launch a new campaign, the product team might use them to decide on new features to build, and the development team might use them to improve the overall user experience. 

In this project, I used SQL and MySQL Workbench as a tool to analyze Instagram user data and answer questions posed by the management team. The insights will help the product manager and the rest of the team make informed decisions about the future direction of the Instagram app. The goal of this project is to use SQL skills to extract meaningful insights from the data. The findings could potentially influence the future development of one of the world's most popular social media platforms.
